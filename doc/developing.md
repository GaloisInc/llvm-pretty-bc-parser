## Building

Make sure you have cloned the `llvm-pretty` submodule before building:

```bash
$ git submodule update --init
$ cabal build
```

## Running the tests

### `llvm-disasm-test`

#### description

This test compares the behavior of `llvm-disasm` against that of `llvm-dis`, by
having them both disassemble the same file and diffing their output (in general,
we don't expect them to exactly match).

Additionally, by default this test does a "round-trip" comparison of
`llvm-disasm` against itself. After disassembling the first time, it reassembles
the output of `llvm-disasm` and runs it again. It then compares both the
ASTs and the LLVM assembly generated by the first and second run of
`llvm-disasm`, to ensure that the printer/parser combo is idempotent.

#### use

To compare the behavior of `llvm-disasm` against that of `llvm-dis`:
```bash
cabal build
./dist/build/disasm-test/disasm-test ./disasm-test/tests/fun-attrs.ll

# When using cabal new-build, the binary locations aren't so nice.
$(find . -name disasm-test -type f) disasm-test/tests/*.ll
```
To see all the options,
```bash
./dist/build/disasm-test/disasm-test --help
```

If you have [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) installed, you can easily compare
against multiple versions of `llvm-dis`, e.g.
```bash
nix-shell --pure -p llvm_6 --run "./dist/build/disasm-test/disasm-test ./disasm-test/tests/fun-attrs.ll"
```

### `regression-test`

See [the README in that directory](../regression-test/README.md).

### `fuzzing`

See [the README in that directory](../fuzzing/README.md).

### `unit-test`

These are run with `cabal test` or `cabal new-test`.
