##> summary: indirectbr pretty-printing is incorrect

Logged in https://github.com/GaloisInc/llvm-pretty/issues/174

These test cases contain `indirectbr` instructions, which `llvm-pretty`'s
pretty-printer does not handle correctly at the moment. As such, when these
tests are round-tripped through `llvm-pretty-bc-parser`, the resulting `.ll`
files cannot be parsed by `llvm-as`:

```
llvm-as: error: expected '[' with indirectbr
  indirectbr ptr %23, label %10, label %17, label %20
                      ^
```

This issue will be resolved once the `llvm-pretty` submodule is updated to
bring in a fix for https://github.com/GaloisInc/llvm-pretty/issues/174.
