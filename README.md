# llvm-pretty-bc-parser

A parser for the LLVM bitcode file format, yielding a `Module` from
[the llvm-pretty package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/llvm-pretty).

## Compatibility

The following table shows what kinds of tests have been/are being run with which
compilers.

 - A check in the the randomized tests column indicates that such tests are
   regularly run [in Github Actions][fuzz-workflow].
 - A check in the manual tests column indicates that the parser seems to work on
   some code that was generated by this compiler.
